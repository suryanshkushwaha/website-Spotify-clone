# Spotify Clone

This project is a clone of Spotify's web player, allowing users to play music, navigate through albums, and control playback. It's a simple web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To use this application on your computer, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/suryanshkushwaha/website-Spotify-clone.git
   ```

2. **Set Up Song Folders**: Inside the project directory, navigate to the `songs` folder. Add your music folders here. Each music folder should contain the songs you want to play. Additionally, inside each music folder, add the following files:
   - `cover.jpg`: Album cover image.
   - `info.json`: JSON file containing the title and description of the album.

3. **Launch the Application**: Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

## Usage

- **Navigation**: Use the left and right arrows to navigate between songs.
- **Play/Pause**: Click on the play/pause button to start or pause playback.
- **Volume Control**: Adjust the volume using the volume slider.
- **Selecting Songs**: Click on a song in the playlist to play it.
- **Album Selection**: Click on an album card to load its songs and start playback.

## Known Bugs

- **Playback Sync Issue**: There may be occasional sync issues between the play/pause buttons and the actual playback.
- **UI/UX Improvements Needed**: The user interface and experience could be enhanced for better usability.
